I was born in Madrid in 1980. My family lived in a couple of suburbs of
this big city until they decided to move away to the lovely Canary Islands.
There, under the warm sun and driven by my never-ending search for knowledge, I
found the two first true loves of my life, somehow intertwined: computers and
videogames.

I was the proud owner of an Atari 2600 and a ZX Spectrum +2A. I
learned to get myself lost in the digital worlds of the videogames, and to dive
even deeper in the mathematic world of the programming languages.

Years later I was bound to return to Madrid. At the capital again, my passion for computers
and anything technology related settled, leading me to study Computer Science
at the *Universidad Autónoma de Madrid*. Around those times I found my third
and final true love: music. I started learning guitar and singing with some
high-school friends, having my own band for a while.

After university I started working as a Computer Engineer always in projects related
to Linux, embedded systems and real-time processing (soft and hard). With 10
years on my shoulders I've touched many technologies ranging from OSes like VxWorks,
Unix, Linux or Android, to systems like radars, Set-Top-Boxes, Conditional Access
servers, Watermarking technologies or DRM software with Trusted Execution Environment.

Nowadays I'm mainly focused on security software for content protection based on
DRM schemes and TEEs to achieve Secure Content Path and full protection of the
content delivery from the server to the presentation on the screen.

In this blog you will find articles and information about my personal own projects
or discoveries, as well as personal opinions about the IT market and the future
of technologies.

Welcome!
