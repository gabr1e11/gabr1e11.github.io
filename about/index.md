I was born in Madrid in 1980. My family lived in a couple of suburbs of this big city until they decided to move away to the lovely Canary Islands. There, under the warm sun and driven by my never-ending search for knowledge I found the two first true loves of my life, somehow intertwined: computers and videogames. I was the proud owner of an Atari 2600 and a ZX Spectrum +2A. I learned to get myself lost in the digital worlds of the videogames, and to dive even deeper in the mathematic world of the programming languages. Years later I was bound to return to Madrid. At the capital again, my passion for computers and anything technology related settled, leading me to study Computer Science at the *Universidad Autónoma de Madrid*. Around those times I found my third and final true love: music. I started learning guitar and singing with some high-school friends, having my own band for a while. Since then I&#8217;ve always found peace and shelter on those intellectual hideouts, allowing me to learn, grow and create. Nowadays I&#8217;m an expat living in Amsterdam, one of the most vibrant cities I know. I still strive for learning and creating, enjoying and understanding the world around me. In this blog you can find scattered bits and pieces from all this corners of my head, sometimes sane, sometimes not. Welcome.
