Recently all has been slowed down. The life, the earth, my environment, the
writing of my story...I feel completely stuck at the edge of a waterfall, being
dragged towards the open space ahead myself. No movements could save me from
falling away. The only thing I can really do is to prepare myself for flying
with my own wings. A wings that have never been used before. Made from wood and
heavy metal, I wonder if they will help me or 'au contraire' they'll push me
down rapidly. Guess there's only one way to know it.

And beneath my feet the clear water runs so free. The memories hit my back
attempting to crush me down. The ideas vanish away from my head, and the
feelings are as cold as never before. Calm down the expectations. Listen to the
white noise coming from the emptiness. Breath deeply. Open your eyes. Feel your
skin and the blood underneath. Pressure is rising. Pressure is lowering.

Future? A familiar guy who I've never understood completely. Though I always
play his game. A game of impossibilities, bad decisions, cranky buddies and
unreachable possibilities. That's the game. Play it or leave now. Common sense
can't be applied. Don't event try it.

Kind of english practice....kind of vital essay....
